# CIFAR10-MLP-CNN

The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the difference 
in performance by an MLP and CNN model.
CIFAR10 will be classified using different MLP 
and CNN models. Each models will have varying hyperparameters
except for the optimizer. For all models, Stochastic Gradient
Decent (SGD) will be used.
